Lola: Hey Grandma, check out these photos I took!
Grandma: Wow, look at those! They are amazing! You have such a great eye
Lola: Thanks, Grandma. I was hoping you’d like them
Grandma: Ha ha ha Like them? I love them!
Grandma: You've really captured the beauty of Solarvale. By the way, Lola, it's been a while since we last cleaned up Whale Rock. The area could use a bit of tidying up. 
Grandma: Why don't you take your camera and head over there? You might find some interesting shots while you’re at it
